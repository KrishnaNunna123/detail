            <h1>Rohit Sharma</h1>
            <P>
                In March 2015, Sharma made his first appearance in the Cricket World Cup and played in eight matches for India in the 2015 tournament in Australia. India reached the semi-final stage where they were defeated by Australia. Sharma scored 330 runs in the tournament with one century, a score of 137 in the quarter-final against Bangladesh.[45]

On 15 April 2019, Sharma was appointed vice-captain of India's squad for the 2019 World Cup in England.[46] In the opening match against South Africa, he scored 122, including his 12,000th run in international cricket.[47][48] He followed it up with centuries against Pakistan, England and Bangladesh. In the match against Sri Lanka, hitting yet another century, he became the first batsman to score five centuries in a single World Cup tournament,[49] and equalled Tendulkar's record for the most centuries (6) in all World Cup matches.[50] Sharma totalled 648 runs in the tournament to finish as the leading run-scorer and win the ICC's Golden Bat award, the third Indian player to do so.[51]
